Its been a long time, I have been wanting to write down all my learnings, mistakes and thoughts as I grow as a programmer, a developer and a human. So, here I am, with my first blog ever. I am really thankful to team [Tighten](https://tighten.co/) for creating such a wonderful tool: [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/), which has helped me to finally make my blog live.

Jigsaw is a static site generator which makes a breeze to create a blog in no time. I know there are a lot of static site generator, some of which are much better than Jigsaw but I chose it because it has been built on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I have been using Laravel for almost three years now and I am just mad about it. Infact, I started my career with Laravel, so I am thankful to [@taylorotwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) for creating such a wonderful framework and making so many lives better.

### Why Hello World?

As a programmer, when we start learning any programming language, the first thing we learn is to print these two beautiful words: "Hello World!". So, I thought it would be best to start my blogging journey with these two words. For me, "Hello World!" is not just an introduction but a promise to a wonderful journey. I am really looking forward to it.
